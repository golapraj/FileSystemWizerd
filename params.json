Suppose we only copy/move/delete only pdf file or only last used at 12/12/2012 file or shortcut file or size less than 5 MB or has name photo from  certain location to a certain location. When number of files to copy/move/delete is small, the task is not very hard, but might be wearisome in some cases. However, when large number of files is concerned the operation becomes as hard as impossible, if not tedious. As the organisation of files in the computer is to be done in the computer itself, the task could best be accomplished by producing an application that does the job for us. Thatâ€™s where our application File System Wizard comes in!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* [Md.
